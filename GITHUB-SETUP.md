## Create Short Links (Recommended)

Use https://bitly.com to create memorable links:

### For Notebooks (share these at workshop):
1. Open: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/analytics-intelligence-workshop/blob/main/notebooks/COLAB_01_setup_and_first_query.ipynb`
2. Add to Colab: Replace `github.com` with `colab.research.google.com/github`
3. Create bit.ly: `bit.ly/npa-setup`

**Repeat for all 3 notebooks:**
- Notebook 1: `bit.ly/npa-setup`
- Notebook 2: `bit.ly/npa-ai-sql`
- Notebook 3: `bit.ly/npa-alerts`

### For Main Repo:
Create: `bit.ly/npa-workshop` ‚Üí Links to your repo

### Update WORKSHOP-LINKS.md
Replace placeholder links with your bit.ly links.

## Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

Host your documentation as a website:

1. Go to repo **Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from branch**
3. Branch: **main**, folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**

Your site will be at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/analytics-intelligence-workshop/`

## Test Colab Links

**Important:** Test that your Colab links work!

1. Open in incognito window (to see what attendees see)
2. Click your bit.ly/npa-setup link
3. Should open in Colab with "Copy to Drive" button
4. Verify all 3 notebooks work

**Colab URL format:**
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-USERNAME/analytics-intelligence-workshop/blob/main/notebooks/COLAB_01_setup_and_first_query.ipynb
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" when pushing:**
- Set up SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
- Or use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`

**"Repository not found":**
- Check remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Update if needed: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git`

**Notebooks not opening in Colab:**
- Verify URL format
- Make sure repo is public
- Try opening directly first (not via bit.ly)
