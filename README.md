## üí° What This Does

**Finds Problems:**
- üö® Tracking breaks (iOS/Android/web)
- üîí PII leaks in your data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing consent flags (GDPR compliance)
- üêõ Data quality issues
- üìâ Event volume drops

**Discovers Opportunities:**
- üéâ Traffic spikes worth investigating
- üîó New high-value referral sources
- üìà Engagement pattern changes
- ‚≠ê Content performing exceptionally well

**Sends Smart Alerts:**
- Slack messages with context and recommendations
- Classified by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Categorized (problem vs opportunity)

---

## üéØ What You'll Build

A system that sends you Slack messages like:

> üö® **Critical: iOS Scroll Tracking Stopped**
>
> scroll_depth events dropped to zero after 2pm on Day 3. This indicates a tracking implementation failure on iOS.
>
> **Recommendation:** Check iOS tracking code immediately. Review recent app deployments.

> üéâ **Opportunity: Newsletter Signup Spike**
>
> Newsletter signups increased 45% on Day 4 compared to baseline. Worth investigating the cause.
>
> **Recommendation:** Review content, email campaigns, or referral sources from that day. Consider replicating success factors.

## üìä Real-World Results (The Associated Press)

**Before this system:**
- Tracking breaks discovered 2-3 weeks late
- 4 hours/week on manual data quality checks
- Opportunities only found in retrospect

**After this system:**
- Alerts within 6 hours of issue
- 0 hours/week on manual checking
- 5+ opportunities discovered per quarter

**Example win:** Newsletter signup spike detected same day ‚Üí investigated ‚Üí found optimal send time (6am) ‚Üí replicated ‚Üí **+25% sustained lift**

   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
   - `GCP_SA_KEY`

## üôã FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have BigQuery?**
A: Works with any SQL database (Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL). Just swap the connector.

**Q: Can I use Claude or Gemini instead of OpenAI?**
A: Yes! Any LLM with function calling support. Easy to adapt.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: You'll tune thresholds over the first 2 weeks. Start conservative (50% drops), then tighten. Tuning guide in playbook.

**Q: How do I convince my boss?**
A: Run it quietly for 2 weeks. When you catch your first tracking break early, forward the Slack alert up. System sells itself.

**Q: Can I test without a production database?**
A: Yes! Use the sample data generator in `data/generate_sample_data.py`. Creates realistic data with planted issues.
