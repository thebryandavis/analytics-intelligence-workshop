# Analytics Intelligence Workshop

A public workshop for checking event data, finding broken tracking, and turning unusual patterns into questions a product team can investigate.

**Status:** Shipped workshop and reference implementation
**Built for:** Product, analytics, and growth teams
**My role:** Product concept, data model, checks, workflow, and workshop

## What I was trying to learn

Can an analytics system do more than report numbers? This project tests whether it can identify a problem or opportunity, explain why it matters, and suggest a reasonable next check.

## What I built

BigQuery, Python, notebooks, configurable checks, and an optional language-model step. The sample data includes planted tracking breaks and growth changes so the workflow can be run end to end.

## What remains unproven

The hard part is deciding which findings deserve attention and showing enough evidence for someone to trust the alert. A production team would still need to tune thresholds against its own data.

## Next step

Add evaluation cases for false positives, PII checks, and missing-consent data before asking a team to run it continuously.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Workshop Attendees

**3 Google Colab Notebooks** (no setup required, runs in browser):

1. **[Setup & First Query](https://tinyurl.com/nycpizza1)** - Connect to BigQuery, explore data
2. **[AI-Generated SQL Checks](https://tinyurl.com/nycpizza2)** - Generate SQL with GPT, find issues
3. **[Anomaly Detection & Alerts](https://tinyurl.com/nycpizza3)** - Classify findings, send Slack alerts

**📖 Take-Home Guide:** [ATTENDEE-HANDOUT.md](ATTENDEE-HANDOUT.md) - Everything you need to deploy this at your org

## 💡 What This Does

**Finds Problems:**
- 🚨 Tracking breaks (iOS/Android/web)
- 🔒 PII leaks in your data
- ⚠️ Missing consent flags (GDPR compliance)
- 🐛 Data quality issues
- 📉 Event volume drops

**Discovers Opportunities:**
- 🎉 Traffic spikes worth investigating
- 🔗 New high-value referral sources
- 📈 Engagement pattern changes
- ⭐ Content performing exceptionally well

**Sends Smart Alerts:**
- Slack messages with context and recommendations
- Classified by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Categorized (problem vs opportunity)

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A system that sends you Slack messages like:

> 🚨 **Critical: iOS Scroll Tracking Stopped**
>
> scroll_depth events dropped to zero after 2pm on Day 3. This indicates a tracking implementation failure on iOS.
>
> **Recommendation:** Check iOS tracking code immediately. Review recent app deployments.

> 🎉 **Opportunity: Newsletter Signup Spike**
>
> Newsletter signups increased 45% on Day 4 compared to baseline. Worth investigating the cause.
>
> **Recommendation:** Review content, email campaigns, or referral sources from that day. Consider replicating success factors.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have BigQuery?**
A: Works with any SQL database (Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL). Just swap the connector.

**Q: Can I use Claude or Gemini instead of OpenAI?**
A: Yes! Any LLM with function calling support. Easy to adapt.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: You'll tune thresholds over the first 2 weeks. Start conservative (50% drops), then tighten. Tuning guide in playbook.

**Q: How do I convince my boss?**
A: Run it quietly for 2 weeks. When you catch your first tracking break early, forward the Slack alert up. System sells itself.

**Q: Can I test without a production database?**
A: Yes! Use the sample data generator in `data/generate_sample_data.py`. Creates realistic data with planted issues.
