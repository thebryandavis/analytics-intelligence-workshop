# Analytics Intelligence Workshop - Take-Home Guide

**News Product Alliance Summit 2025 | Bryan Davis, The Associated Press**

## What You Just Saw

A system that watches your analytics data 24/7 and sends Slack alerts for:
- üö® **Problems**: Tracking breaks, PII leaks, data quality issues
- üéâ **Opportunities**: Traffic spikes, new referrers, behavior changes
- üìä **Insights**: Pattern shifts, emerging trends

**Cost**: < $15/month | **Setup time**: 1-2 hours | **Skills needed**: Copy/paste

---

## How It Works

```
Plain English ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí SQL ‚Üí BigQuery ‚Üí AI Classification ‚Üí Slack Alert
```

**Example:**
- You write: "Find iOS events where scroll_depth dropped below 1000/hour"
- GPT generates: Perfect BigQuery SQL
- System runs it: Finds the problem
- AI classifies it: "Critical tracking break"
- You get Slack: "üö® iOS scroll tracking stopped at 2pm"

**No SQL expertise required**

---

## What We Found Today (In Sample Data)

### Problems Detected
1. ‚úÖ iOS tracking break (after 2pm, Day 3)
2. ‚úÖ 15% missing consent_state (GDPR risk)
3. ‚úÖ PII in URLs (~3,200 events with emails)
4. ‚úÖ ~1% duplicate events

### Opportunities Discovered
1. ‚úÖ Newsletter signups +45% (Day 4)
2. ‚úÖ New Reddit traffic (appeared Day 5)

**Time to find all 6**: 45 minutes (manually would take days/weeks)

---

## Your Take-Home Materials

### Code & Notebooks
- **3 Google Colab notebooks** (ready to run)
- **Complete Python module** (`analytics_intelligence.py`)
- **20+ check templates** (YAML configuration)
- **Sample data generator** (for testing)

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Setup guide with troubleshooting
- **playbook.md**: Deployment options and best practices

### Access
- **GitHub repo**: email Bryan

---

## Get Started Monday Morning

### Option 1: Quick Test (30 min)
1. Open the Colab notebooks (no install needed)
2. Use the sample data (already loaded)
3. Run through all 3 notebooks
4. See it find all 6 issues

**Perfect if**: You want to understand before deploying

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Production (2 hours)

#### Step 1: Get Data into BigQuery (30-60 min)
**If you have GA4:**
```bash
# Enable BigQuery export in GA4 settings
# Data appears automatically in BigQuery
```

**If you have CSV/JSON:**
```bash
# Load from local file
bq load --source_format=CSV mydataset.events data.csv schema.json

# Or load from Google Cloud Storage
bq load mydataset.events gs://bucket/data.csv schema.json
```

**If you stream events:**
- See `data/load_to_bigquery.py` for streaming example

---

#### Step 2: Customize Checks (15 min)
Edit `config/checks.yaml`:

```yaml
checks:
  - name: "Your Custom Check"
    description: |
      Describe what you want to check in plain English.
      Example: Find days where video_start events dropped >20%.
    enabled: true
```

Add checks for:
- Your specific event types
- Your tracking plan requirements
- Your compliance needs
- Your business metrics

---

#### Step 3: Deploy (30 min)

**Recommended: GitHub Actions (Free)**

1. Create `.github/workflows/analytics-checks.yml`:
```yaml
name: Analytics Intelligence Checks
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours

jobs:
  run-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: python run_checks.py
    env:
      GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}
      SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

2. Add secrets in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Secrets
3. Push code
4. It runs automatically!

**Alternative: Google Cloud Functions**
- See `docs/playbook.md` for detailed instructions
- Native BigQuery integration
- Serverless, auto-scaling

---

#### Step 4: Receive Alerts (< 10 min after deploy)
Slack alerts start arriving within hours!

## Costs (Monthly)

| Component | Workshop | Production (GPT-3.5) | Production (GPT-4) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| BigQuery | $0 | ~$5 | ~$5 |
| OpenAI API | $0.50 | ~$3 | ~$72 |
| Compute | $0 | $0 (GitHub Actions) | $0 |
| **Total** | **<$1** | **~$8/month** | **~$80/month** |

**Recommended**: Use GPT-3.5 (10x cheaper, works great)

**ROI**: Catch one tracking break early ‚Üí save thousands in lost data

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have BigQuery?**
A: Works with any SQL database - just change the connector. Examples for Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL in playbook.

**Q: Can I use without AI?**
A: Yes! Write SQL by hand, skip generation. Classification and alerting still work.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: Tune thresholds in `checks.yaml`. System learns your baselines over time.

**Q: How do I add custom checks?**
A: Just edit `checks.yaml` - describe in plain English, enable it, done.

**Q: Can I send alerts to other tools?**
A: Yes! Modify `SlackAlerter` class to send to PagerDuty, Jira, email, Teams, etc.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### ‚úÖ Good Prompts (Specific, Contextual, Actionable)
```
Find iOS events where scroll_depth count < 100/hour.
Compare to 7-day average for iOS scroll_depth.
Show: event_date, hour, ios_scroll_count, expected_count.
Flag rows where percentage deviation > 50%.
```

### ‚ùå Bad Prompts (Vague, No Context)
```
Check the data
Find anomalies
Look for problems
```

### Pro Tips
- Be specific about thresholds
- Provide comparison context (vs average, vs yesterday)
- Name the columns you want in output
- Specify filtering logic
- Give examples of what you're looking for
